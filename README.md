# Stockfighter PHP API Wrapper

I use this library inside my solutions repository, and thought I'd share it with the world.
My solutions repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sammarks/stockfighter-solution-php)
(*spoiler alert*).

## Installation

Just install this library using Composer.

```
composer install sammarks/stockfighter
```

Or you can require it into your project using:

```
composer require sammarks/stockfighter
```

## Usage

I have to write some code first!

## Contributing

If you find an error in my Stockfighter library, or would like to improve it because you're using
it in your own Stockfighter solutions, just send me a pull request! I promise I'll be very open
to suggestions.
